2.0.0

Backwards Incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Minimum Python version is now 2.7.
* Removed 'debug' kwargs in favor of Python's logging.
* RGBColor channels are now [0..1] instead of [1..255]. Can get the upscaled
  Can use RGBColor.get_upscaled_value_tuple() to get the upscaled values.
* RGBColor.set_from_rgb_hex() was replaced with a RGBColor.new_from_rgb_hex(),
  which returns a properly formed RGBColor object.
* RGBColor no longer accepts observer or illuminant kwargs.
* HSL no longer accepts observer or illuminant kwargs.
* HSV no longer accepts observer or illuminant kwargs.
* CMY no longer accepts observer or illuminant kwargs.
* CMYK no longer accepts observer or illuminant kwargs.

Features
^^^^^^^^
* Python 3.3 support added.
* Added tox.ini with supported environments.
* Removed the old custom test runner in favor of nose.
* Replacing simplified RGB->XYZ conversions with Bruce Lindbloom's.
* A round of PEP8 work.
* Added a BaseColorConversionTest test class with some greatly improved
  color comparison. Much more useful in tracking down breakages.
* Each color space inherits from one of ReflectiveColorBase or
  TransmissiveColorBase. This currently serves no purpose other than to
  allow for conditions in color software. Most (but not all) reflective
  color spaces have illuminants.

Bugs
^^^^

* Corrected delta_e CMC example error. Should now run correctly.
* Un-hardcoded XYZColor.apply_adaptation()'s adaptation and observer angles.

1.0.9
-----

Features
^^^^^^^^
* Added an optional vectorized deltaE function. This uses NumPy array/matrix
  math for a very large speed boost. (Eddie Bell)
* Added this changelog.

Bugs
^^^^
* Un-hardcode the observer angle in adaptation matrix. (Bastien Dejean)

1.0.8
-----

* Initial GitHub release.
