                            Python Color Math Module
                                   (colormath)

What is it?
-----------
This module implements a large number of different color operations such as
color space conversions, Delta E, and density to spectral.

Why?
----
Public documentation for color math is very limited, and there were no Python
color math libraries with even a fraction of the common routines implemented.

Requirements
------------
colormath requires NumPy, which you may get from:
 
    http://numpy.scipy.org/

Installation
------------
As root/admin on your machine:
  python setup.py install
  
Documentation
-------------
As of right now, the only documentation are the examples in the examples
directory. There's a whole lot going on right now, and not much time for
cleanly documenting this stuff. However, the source code is very well
commented.

Support
-------
Head over to http://code.google.com/p/python-colormath/issues/list
and submut an issue if you have any problems or questions.
